        <p>Sculpture is the branch of the visual arts that operate in three dimensions.It is one of the plastic arts.</p>
        <p>Durable sculptural processes originally used carving(the removal of material) and modelling(the addition of materials, as clay), in stone, metal, ceramics,wood and other materials but, since Modernism, there has been an almost complete freedom of materials and process.<br>A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by welding or modelling,or moulded or cast.</p><br>

        <p>Sculpture in stone survives far better than works of art in perishable materials, and often represents the majority of the surviving works (other than pottery) from ancient cultures, though conversely traditions of sculpture in wood may have vanished almost entirely. However, most ancient sculpture was brightly painted, and this has been lost. </p>
